To Do:  
+ integrate SCSS and Flexbox
+ add disclaimer, privacy policy, etc.
  - Any parking signs override information found here. Do not soley rely on this application to determining where to park. You are ultimately responsible for parking properly so always have some situatioonal awareness of the sithuation. This app can only assist you in navigating Minneapolis's Snow Emergency System.   Dealing with the parking rules is no fun, but it allows the snow plows to do their job.
+ avoid dedicated application; see if notifications would be possible through browser or some other means
	- maybe even just direct them to signup for official mpls notifications
+ add ability to switch basemap (non-mvp)
+ host your own tiles with postgis? (non-mvp)
+ restrict map to mpls
+ Add home button - zooms to extent of Minneapolis
+ finish acquiring data from mpls; optimize if possible (remove erraneous pts, etc. [non-mvp])
+ draw geojson polys from mpls data
+ emergency status module that can toggle between day 1, day 2, and day 3 - default state = 1
	- some safety check on the server side to make sure it is always accurate
	- clearly display live Snow Emergency Status
		* No Emergency Declared, Currently Day 1, Day 2, or Day 3
	- Clearly state parking rules for the current status period and the upcoming
	- button: "Show me a 'what-if' one was declared today"
	- while emergency is in effect, auto-populate the day information area with relevant days; i.e. day2 will be 8 AM - 8 PM Tuesday, Jan 4th, etc.
	- Expand button to display more info
		- will not be declared after X:00 PM
		* general info like blue signs, the official rules/pictures from mpls, etc.
+ Day Information area
	- on mobile, horizantally spread across the bottom (like G Maps "Explore, Commute, For You")
	- on Desktop, vertically spread on left side of screen; have the awesome-font-arrow thing rotate
	- toggling the days, toggles the parking polygon/geojson colors on the map
+ expand menu button (three horizontal lines) at top left, next to search (on mobile anyway)
	- on mobile -> button integrated with search (Like Google Maps)
	- on desktop -> integrate with emergency status module (mimic desktop google maps)
	- settings w/ customization options (non-mvp)
	- feedback/bug report (non-mvp)
	- link to official mpls snow emergency page
	- donation/remove ads - need to setup an account for this then or download the app
+ auto location test (non-mvp)
	- check user location, have them confirm they are between the two blocks, and give them a thumbs up or thumbs download
	- extra disclaimer saying (we can't be 100% certain you are properly parked and cannot account for driveways, fire hydrants, etc.)
	- allow hide disclaimer in the future
+ report that the road section has been plowed (non-mvp)
